Project Description

Summary: Home Service project uses multiple ROS packages to develop robot to pick up and drop off virtual object in the static environment. This is a brief description of ROS packages utilized in this project. Turtlebot robot with a RGBD camera is being used for this project.  


Package#1- Turtebot_gazeo: This package is used to deploy turtlebot robot inside gazebo world. By modifying path of the world in turtlebot_world.launch file, a customize world can be used. This package also has amcl_demo which is used to localize and intialize robot pose. Adapted monte carlo localize is used to localize the robot. 

Package#2- slam_gmapping: This package contains slam parameters using gmapping. A map of an environment can be generated by gmapping and teleop operation.

Package#3- turtlebot_teleop: This is used to move robot with keyboard in the environment. This is utilized with slam package to create an environment.

Package#4- rviz_launchers: This contains preconfigured rviz file with all the settings needed for this project. Marker was added and saved in rvizconfig package.

Package#4- ROS navigation stack: ros navigation stack uses odometry and sensor(rgbd) data to ouput velocity command to the robot. The navigation stack with Rviz receives goal location from user defined node(pick_objects node). 

Custom package: Pick objects: This package sends target locations to navigation stack. 

Add_markers: virtual markers are created in rviz world. Markers are located at pick up and drop off location. These are triggered ON/OFF based on robot's location in the environment.
